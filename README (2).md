## Laundering Pattern Transactions
### Research of synthetic transaction data from IBM for the presence of money laundering indicators
The problem of Money Laundering has always existed everywhere, it has no borders. Over time, with the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, Money Laundering fraud schemes are becoming more and more complicated.
By definition, Money Laundering is the movement of illicit funds in order to conceal their origin, while creating complex transaction schemes.
Unfortunately, real transaction data is not available to study Money Laundering models (banks cannot provide such data to the public).That is why synthetic transaction data from IBM is used to create a training model of Money Laundering. Financial transactions in this model are conducted via banks, i.e. the payer and receiver both have accounts, with accounts taking multiple forms from checking to credit cards or bitcoin.
